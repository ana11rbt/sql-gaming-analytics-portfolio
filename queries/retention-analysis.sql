-- ============================================================================
-- BUSINESS INSIGHTS SUMMARY
-- ============================================================================
-- 
-- KEY FINDINGS (Based on Analysis):
-- 1. Cohort retention trends identify best/worst performing install periods
-- 2. Acquisition source quality reveals optimal marketing channel allocation  
-- 3. Revenue-retention correlation shows LTV impact of retention improvements
-- 4. Churn risk segmentation enables proactive re-engagement campaigns
--
-- ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
-- - Focus marketing spend on highest-retention acquisition sources
-- - Implement targeted onboarding for cohorts with <X% D1 retention
-- - Deploy re-engagement campaigns for "Medium Risk" churn segment
-- - Optimize early monetization for D7+ retained players
